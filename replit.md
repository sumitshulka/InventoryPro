# Inventory Management System

## Overview

A comprehensive inventory management system built with React (frontend) and Express.js (backend), featuring role-based access control, warehouse management, and real-time inventory tracking. The system supports multiple user roles including administrators, managers, warehouse operators, and employees with varying levels of access and functionality.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Custom components built with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy and session-based auth
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session store with express-session
- **API Design**: RESTful API architecture

### Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions
- **Schema**: Comprehensive schema covering users, departments, warehouses, items, inventory, transactions, transfers, and audit logs
- **Migrations**: Version-controlled database migrations in `/migrations`

## Key Components

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based authentication** using Passport.js
- **Role-based access control** with four user roles:
  - Admin: Full system access
  - Manager: Department and warehouse management
  - Warehouse Operator: Inventory operations
  - Employee: Request submission only
- **Password hashing** using MD5 with salt (upgradeable)
- **Password reset** functionality with email tokens

### Inventory Management
- **Multi-warehouse support** with location tracking
- **Item master data** with categories and SKU management
- **Real-time inventory tracking** across warehouses
- **Stock level monitoring** with low stock alerts
- **Disposal tracking** for rejected and disposed items

### Request & Approval System
- **Request workflow** for inventory items
- **Configurable approval settings** based on request type and amount
- **Multi-level approval process** with status tracking
- **Transfer notifications** for inter-warehouse transfers

### Reporting & Analytics
- **Stock reports** with filtering and export capabilities
- **Movement reports** tracking all inventory transactions
- **Valuation reports** showing inventory worth
- **Analytics dashboard** with fastest-moving items and trends
- **Audit trail** for all system activities

### User Interface
- **Responsive design** using Tailwind CSS
- **Professional theme** with consistent styling
- **Data tables** with pagination, sorting, and filtering
- **Modal dialogs** for forms and confirmations
- **Toast notifications** for user feedback

## Data Flow

### Request Processing Flow
1. Employee submits item request
2. System checks approval requirements
3. Request routed to appropriate approver(s)
4. Upon approval, system checks inventory availability
5. If unavailable, transfer notification created
6. Warehouse operator processes transfer/fulfillment
7. Transaction recorded and inventory updated

### Inventory Update Flow
1. Check-in creates inbound transaction
2. Transfer moves inventory between warehouses
3. Issue/disposal creates outbound transaction
4. All transactions update inventory quantities
5. Audit logs track all changes

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. Passport.js validates against database
3. Session created and stored in PostgreSQL
4. Frontend receives user data
5. Subsequent requests include session cookie

## External Dependencies
